<h3>
  <a id="logo" class="logo" href="#logo" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>our logo & usage</h3>
<p>The sovrn logotype and bars were developed to provide the foundation for a consistent application of the sovrn brand across all products and media including interface, web, collateral, promotions and advertising. Consistently expressing the sovrn  visual identity builds a strong brand awareness, allowing sovrn to be the recognized leader in its space. Please follow these guidelines for the most effect brand expression.
The sovrn corporate logo is made up of both the bars and the sovrn logotype. These two elements should appear as shown here in all corporate materials, including the sovrn website and collateral materials.</p>
